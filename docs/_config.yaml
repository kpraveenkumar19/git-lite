description: git-lite is a simple tool to download a Git repository with single command. It focuses on a implementation of git client using Git's Smart HTTP in Java. It’s simple, fast and aimed at basic use. It uses [Git's Smart HTTP Protocol](https://git-scm.com/docs/http-protocol) along with [Git object](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects) handling under the hood and writes files directly without any ZIP downloads or extraction.
